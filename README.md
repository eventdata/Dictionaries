===== KEDS LEVANT SEQUENCE DICTIONARIES =====

These dictionaries were used to generate the 1979-2011 Levant sequences for AFP and
Reuters. Note that this did not use .agents files, which came later.

CAMEO.080612.verbs

===== VERY OLD KEDS DICTIONARIES =====

These are the dictionaries used to produce the other main event sequences for the KEDS 
project. These use WEIS rather than CAMEO coding and would probably only be of 
interest if you are trying to code these areas for the 1990s.
